 - Hey can you wait just for a little bit, I need to really quickly finish this science assignment. Basically, I just need to transfer some lines of code from homepage.html to home3.html. It should work.
 - HOWEVER,PLEASE DO NOT PUSH TO GITHUB SINCE WE ARE STILL TESTING. I am going to let you know when you can do that, so munchysite does not explode.

 #### Helpful things:
 ```
YOU SHOULD ALWAY HAVE MARKDOWN SELECTED ON THE RIGHT, BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT ON THE FILE, YOU CAN STILL SEE THE CHAT!!!!!

# is h1, and the more hashtags you add, you get the jist (# h1, ## h2, ### h3, ect)

``` Is the opening and closing tag for a snippit of code.

` code ` is for a single line of code.

[link text]{link} is for a link
![alt text]{source} is for an image

--- is for a divider

YOU CAN INCLUDE HTML ELEMENTS DIRECTLY IN THE MARK DOWN FILE AND IT WILL RENDER IT ( I don't think it does color though :( )

 ```
